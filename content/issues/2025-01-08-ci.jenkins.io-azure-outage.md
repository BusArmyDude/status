The Azure outage finished the 04:30 UTC on 11 Jan 2025 (as per <https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/>, Tracking ID: `PLP3-1W8`).
Windows (container) builds are now flowing on ci.jenkins.io.

[Initial Message]
A network Azure outage in the region US East 2 started at 22:00 UTC the 8 January 2025 impacts the Jenkins infrastructure.

Most notably, Windows container agents (using Azure Container Instances) are not starting, associated builds are stuck in the queue.

Short term: users can set `useContainerAgent` to `false` in their `buildPlugin()` pipeline library function to force usage of VMs instead of containers.
